// Content budget guard. Four silent failures the engine does NOT catch for you — each builds green
// and breaks only on screen, so they are checked here:
//
//   1. LEAF CARDS are a fixed NODE_W×NODE_H (210×96). Only containers grow to fit their text
//      (layout.ts headerHeight). A leaf whose label/sub overruns the ~134px text column spills
//      outside its card, top and bottom — the text block is vertically centred.
//   2. SLIDES do not scale to fit. useSlideScale sets `zoom = paneWidth / 806` — width-proportional
//      only — so type size is fixed by the frame and an over-long slide CLIPS at the bottom
//      (.slide-panel is `align-items: safe center`, which falls back to start when content
//      overflows). The pane is 1081 DESIGN px tall at 16:9, so the check MODELS the rendered height.
//
//      Character count is a poor proxy and was the earlier check: a bullet-heavy slide renders far
//      taller than a prose one of the same length. The slide that actually clipped was 869 chars
//      (modelling 1198px) while a 895-char slide rendered fine (953px) — the bullets each wrapped to
//      two lines. Height is what matters.
//
//      Every constant below is MEASURED off the rendered app (canvas measureText against the real
//      faces, computed styles off the real elements), against 18 slides whose true height was read
//      out of the DOM. It lands within ±3.5%, and that error is irreducible: the face is
//      proportional, so a line of wide words overflows a character budget a line of narrow ones
//      fits, and one wrapped block can be off by a line (37.7px) either way. This catches the gross
//      case. THE ORACLE IS THE RENDERED DOM — see the note on SLIDE_H_MAX.
//   3. A `focus:` on a Section that names no node in its scene is a silent no-op — SceneView marks
//      `__focus` by id comparison and simply never matches, so the section renders with nothing lit.
//   4. A SECTION WITH NO WAV narrates nothing. The app resolves audio by convention —
//      public/audio/<course>/<section-id>.wav — so a renamed section id or a missed file plays
//      silence in the app and records a SILENT segment, with no error anywhere.
//
// NOT checked here: the `icon:` registry guard that data-warehousing/sql/linux carry. Theirs reads
// src/render-engine/*Icons.ts — a path the engine extraction deleted, which is why `npm run check`
// throws ENOENT in those three repos. The published @graphlearning/flow does not enumerate its icon
// keys (dist/lucideIcons.d.ts is just `Record<string, LucideIcon>`), so there is nothing to read
// against. Keep icon names honest by eye until the package exports the registry.
//
// Run: npm run check

// --- leaf-card budget -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A leaf card is 210×96 with a 134px text column (icon 26 + gap 14 + padding 18×2). What matters is
// how many LINES the text wraps to, and the ceiling is the CARD'S OWN HEIGHT — not another repo's
// tolerance. Practical rule: keep the LABEL to 2 wrapped lines; 2 label + 2 sub = 76px and fits.
const CARD_H_MAX = 92

const SUB_CPL = 20 // chars per line at 13px
const LINE_LABEL = 21.6 // 18px × 1.2
const LINE_SUB = 15.6 // 13px × 1.2
// Landscape design metrics, read off index.css (.stage--section .slide-panel__scaler).
// The pane measures 1078 DESIGN px — read off the rendered app as `panel.clientHeight / zoom`, not
// guessed. Every constant in this model was measured the same way (see CPX below), and against 18
// slides whose true height was read out of the DOM it lands within ±3.5%.
//
// That ±3.5% is IRREDUCIBLE, and worth understanding before tightening this number. The model
// counts characters; the face is proportional, so a line of wide words overflows a character budget
// a line of narrow ones fits. One wrapped block can therefore be off by a line (37.7px) either way.
// Lowering the ceiling to cover the worst undercount would flag six slides that are verified
// correct on screen, which is how a guard gets ignored.
//
// So this catches the gross case, and the ORACLE IS THE RENDERED DOM. To read the truth for a
// section, with the dev server up and the section routed:
//
//   const p = document.querySelector('.slide-panel')
//   const sc = document.querySelector('.slide-panel__scaler')
//   sc.scrollHeight                          // the slide's true design height
//   p.scrollHeight > p.clientHeight + 1      // whether it is actually clipping
